 Tip Calculator 
Instructions
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

Example Input:
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7

Example Output:
Each person should pay: $19.93

Code : 
"""
print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
amount = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10,12,or 15 "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

amount += (amount * float(tip))/100
charges = amount / float(people)

print(f"Each person should pay : ${round(charges,2)}")
