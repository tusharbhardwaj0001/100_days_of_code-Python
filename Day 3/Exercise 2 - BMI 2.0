Problem : Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

 -Under 18.5 they are underweight
 -Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
 -Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
 -Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
 -Above 35 they are clinically obese
 
 Example Input : 
 weight = 85 
 height = 1.75

Example Output : 
85 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

Code: 
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

BMI = weight/(height ** 2)
if BMI < 18.5 :
    print (f"Your BMI is {round(BMI)}, you are underweight.")
elif BMI >18.5 and BMI <25:
    print (f"Your BMI is {round(BMI)}, you have a normal weight.")
elif BMI>=25 and BMI < 30:
    print (f"Your BMI is {round(BMI)}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif BMI >= 30 and BMI < 35:
    print (f"Your BMI is {round(BMI)}, you are obese.")
else :
    print (f"Your BMI is {round(BMI)}, you are clinically obese.")
